# Hashing Tests

This repository contains a script to run tests for various hashing algorithms. The tests are designed to verify the correctness and performance of different hashing techniques.

## Introduction

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves transforming data into a fixed-size value, typically for efficient storage and retrieval. This repository provides a code to run a set of tests that can be used to evaluate the implementation of different hashing algorithms.

## Usage

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (should work both on Linux and Windows).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. The code in solver.py is only an example implementation of hashing algorythms
4. Run the checker.py after correctly setting the number of tests

## Tests

The repository includes only a few example test cases.

You can find the tests in the `in/` directory. Feel free to explore the individual test files to understand the specific scenarios being tested and add your own test scenarios.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add a set of new tests just create a new branch and start a pull request.
